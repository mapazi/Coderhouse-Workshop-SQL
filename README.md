# Workshop SQL

## Coderhouse Platform Analysis

### Description
This short workshop is part of the Data Analytics Course in Coderhouse where I put into pratice what I learnt in my first classes of SQL. This is my solution (in spanish) according to the teacher's instructions. It is divided in three parts, the last part I performed a business analysis at operational and strategic level to get insights for decision-making.
